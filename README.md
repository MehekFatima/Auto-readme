## Adding npm Global Bin Directory to PATH

To ensure that globally installed npm packages are accessible from the command line, you may need to add the npm global bin directory to your PATH environment variable. Hereâ€™s how to do it on Windows and macOS:

### On Windows

1. **Find the npm Global Directory**

   Run the following command in your terminal to find the global npm directory:

```bash
