## How to Format Comments for `auto-readme-creator`

To make the most out of `auto-readme-creator` and generate a well-organized `README.md` file, follow these guidelines for formatting comments in your source files.

**Comment Syntax**

1. Headings:
 - Comments that should become headings in the README file should be written without any special prefixes. Simply write your comment on a new line.
 - Example:
 ```bash
    // This is a heading
```
2. Paragraphs:
 - Comments that should be included as paragraphs under the preceding heading should start with the tilde symbol `~`. Everything after the `~` will be considered part of the paragraph.
 - Example:
 ```bash
   // ~ This is the first paragraph under the heading
   // ~ This is the second paragraph under the same heading
```

## Adding npm Global Bin Directory to PATH

To ensure that globally installed npm packages are accessible from the command line, you may need to add the npm global bin directory to your PATH environment variable. Hereâ€™s how to do it on Windows and macOS:

### On Windows

1. **Find the npm Global Directory**

   Run the following command in your terminal to find the global npm directory:

```bash
   npm config get prefix
```
This will return a path, such as `C:\Users\YourUsername\AppData\Roaming\npm.`

2. **Add the Directory to PATH**

  - Open the Start Menu and search for "Environment Variables".
  - Click on "Edit the system environment variables."
  - In the System Properties window, click on the "Environment Variables" button.
  - In the Environment Variables window, find the "Path" variable under "System variables" and select it.
 - Click "Edit."
 - Click "New" and add the path you obtained from the npm config get prefix command.
 - Click "OK" to close all dialogs.

 ## On macOS
1. **Find the npm Global Directory**

 Run the following command in your terminal to find the global npm directory:

 ```bash
    npm config get prefix
```
This will return a path, such as /usr/local.

2. **Add the Directory to PATH**
- Open your terminal.

-  your shell profile file (`.bash_profile`, `.zshrc`, or `.bashrc` depending on your shell) using a text editor. For example:

```bash
   nano ~/.bash_profile
```
- Add the following line to include the npm global bin directory in your PATH:

```bash
   export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin
```
